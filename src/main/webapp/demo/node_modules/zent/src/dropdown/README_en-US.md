A component pops down.

We don't provide a specific component called `Dropdown`. The function of `Dropdown` component is a subset of function of `Popover` component. This doc decribes how to use `Popover` to implement a `Dropdown`.

### Usage

Generally, the component is used for dropdown menu.

### API

### About position

It's recommanded to use `AutoXxxYxx` provided by `Popover` for positioning. E.g. it's positioned below the lower left corner, but the position will be adjusted if it's out of the screen.
